# Ansible Inventories:

* Ansible works against multiple nodes or “hosts” for  your infrastructure at the same time.
* By using a list or group of lists know as inventory. 
* Once your inventory is defined, you can use to select the hosts or groups you can run  Ansible commands.
* Ansible uses a combination of a hosts file and a group_vars directory to pull variables per host group and run Ansible plays/tasks against hosts.
* The default location for inventory is a file called /etc/ansible/hosts.
* We can be called  from a different host  file  by using  -i
* You can also use multiple inventory files at the same time.


## Inventories are two types
* Satic 
* Dynamic


### Static Inventory:
> manually add or remove hosts from list or group lists, static inventory.
