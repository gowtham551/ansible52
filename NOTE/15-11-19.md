# Ansible Inventories:

* Ansible works against multiple nodes or “hosts” for  your infrastructure at the same time.
* By using a list or group of lists know as inventory. 
* Once your inventory is defined, you can use to select the hosts or groups you can run  Ansible commands.
* Ansible uses a combination of a hosts file and a group_vars directory to pull variables per host group and run Ansible plays/tasks against hosts.
* The default location for inventory is a file called /etc/ansible/hosts.
* We can be called  from a different host  file  by using  -i
* You can also use multiple inventory files at the same time.


## Inventories are two types
* Satic 
* Dynamic


### Static Inventory:
> manually add or remove hosts from list or group lists, static inventory.

```
[webservers]
foo.example.com
bar.example.com

[dbservers]
one.example.com
two.example.com
```

# Ansible Variables:
* It helps you to use and assign a value to a variable and use that anywhere in the playbook. 

* One can put conditions around the value of the variables and accordingly use them in the playbook.

## Variables can define in inventory:

* If all hosts in a group share a variable value, you can apply that variable to an entire group at once

```
[atlanta]
host1
host2

[atlanta:vars]
ntp_server=ntp.atlanta.example.com
proxy=proxy.atlanta.example.com
```
> by using group vars, the scop of variables upto that group

## Variable can define in playbook:

 ```
 - hosts: webservers
   vars:
    http_port: 80

 ```

 > This variables scop up to that playbook only.
